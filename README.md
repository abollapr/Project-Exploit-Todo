# Project-Exploit-Todo

For this project, a simple Linux command line application, written in C was utilized. We used the command line application Todo which is a simple task manager tool. The functionality of Todo is to let users enter their task list to the application which is in turn recorded into .txt file. Users can create, delete, update tasks and perform other such activities with the help of this tool. With the knowledge of implicit vulnerabilities in C functions, it was possible to perform exploits on the application.

Exploits:
1. Format String vulnerabilties:
   a. Buffer Overflow using sprintf to achieve shell code access. 
   b. Arbritary read using printf format identifiers.
   c. Arbitary write using printf format identifiers.
   
2.  Buffer Overflow vulnerabilties 
    a. Causing buffer overflow using strcpy causing return pointer corruption.
    b. Create an arc injection and cause libc function call with /bin/sh.
